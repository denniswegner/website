# Setup

This Projekt was created with Webstorm. It uses [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) to build assets from src into dist.

If you have Gulp installed, you can run gulp build in your project directory.

``` 
$ gulp build
```

To install missing dependencies use
